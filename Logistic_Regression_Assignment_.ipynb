        "## **Question 1: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a supervised learning technique used to model the relationship between **one independent variable (X)** and **one dependent variable (Y)** by fitting a straight line to observed data.\n",
        "Its main purpose is to **predict the value of the dependent variable** based on the independent variable and to understand how changes in X affect Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Linearity:** There is a linear relationship between X and Y.\n",
        "2. **Independence:** Observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "3. **Homoscedasticity:** Constant variance of errors across all levels of X.\n",
        "4. **Normality:** Residuals (errors) are normally distributed.\n",
        "5. **No multicollinearity:** Since SLR has only one independent variable, this assumption is automatically satisfied.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Question 3: Write the mathematical equation for a simple linear regression model and explain each term.**\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A real-world example of Simple Linear Regression is **predicting house prices based on house size**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Independent Variable (X): Area of the house (in sq. ft.)\n",
        "* Dependent Variable (Y): House price\n",

        "## **Question 5: What is the method of least squares in linear regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The **method of least squares** is used to estimate the best-fitting regression line by **minimizing the sum of squared differences** between the actual values and the predicted values.\n",
        "It ensures that the regression line is as close as possible to all data points.\n",
